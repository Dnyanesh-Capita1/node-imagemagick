This is a safe version of (imagemagick)(https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemagick) npm package, addressing the (ImageTragick)[https://imagetragick.com/] vulnerabilities by disabling the vulnerable pieces of functionality, using the following ImageMagick policy:

```xml
<policymap>
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="EPHEMERAL" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="URL" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="HTTPS" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="MVG" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="MSL" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="TEXT" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="SHOW" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="WIN" />
  <policy domain="coder" rights="none" pattern="PLT" />
</policymap>
```
